            <p class="body-lg light">Back n Forth provides the Services to you “as is”. You acknowledge that the services are not error-free. You use it at your own risk and discretion. That means the Services do not come with any warranty. None express, none implied. The Services will be continually developed, and you acknowledge that changes to functionality and layout may be carried out without advance notice. Back n Forth makes no warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the availability, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, completeness, performance and quality of the services. Back n Forth will from time to time have to carry out updates and maintenance of the services, due to technical, security or operational reasons, during which time the services might be unavailable. Back n Forth will make reasonable efforts to arrange updates and maintenance outside of peak usage hours.</p>
            <h2 class="title-2xl white legal-title">13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p class="body-lg light">In no event shall Back n Forth be liable to you or any third party for any special, punitive, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind, or any damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, those resulting from loss of use, data or profits, whether or not we have been advised of the possibility of such damages, and on any theory of liability, arising out of or in connection with the use of the Service or of any website referenced or linked to from the Service.</p>
            <p class="body-lg light">Further, Back n Forth shall not be liable in any way for any engagement, third party goods, and services offered through our Service or for assistance in conducting commercial transactions with other users of the site, including without limitation any transaction between a Creator and Supporter.</p>
            <p class="body-lg light">Some jurisdictions prohibit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>

            <h2 class="title-2xl white legal-title">15. Binding Arbitration; Class Waiver</h2>
            <p class="body-lg light">You expressly agrees that any legal claim, dispute or other controversy between you and Back n Forth or you and any of the Back n Forth partners arising out of or otherwise relating in any way to Back n Forth, the Platform, the Content or the Services, or any other Back n Forth goods, services or advertising, including controversies relating to the applicability, enforceability or validity of any provision of these terms (collectively “Dispute(s)”), shall be resolved in confidential binding arbitration conducted before one commercial arbitrator in Back n Forth’s local jurisdiction, rather than in a court, as described herein. The arbitration will be governed by the commercial arbitration rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes (collectively “Rules and Procedures”). You acknowledge that you are voluntarily and knowingly forfeiting your right to a trial by jury and to otherwise proceed in a lawsuit through court, except as expressly provided herein.</p>
            <p class="body-lg light">Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.</p>
            <p class="body-lg light">Payment of arbitration costs will be governed by the arbitrator, unless you are able to show that your portion will be prohibitive as compared to litigation costs, in which case Back n Forth will pay as much of your arbitration costs as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to litigation costs. Back n Forth also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all arbitration costs imposed upon us. Each party agrees to pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a governing statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid attorneys’ fees and expenses.</p>

            <p class="body-lg light"><strong>Severability.</strong> All parts of these Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.

Except as otherwise provided in the Terms, the invalidity of part of this Terms will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.

You may not enter into any contract on our behalf or bind us in any way.</p>
            <p class="body-lg light"><strong>Force Majeure.</strong> Force Majeure means any circumstances beyond the reasonable control of either party, including, without limitation, fire, explosion, strikes or other labor disputes, riots or other civil disturbances, voluntary or involuntary compliance with any law, order regulation, recommendation or request of any governmental authority, and errors or downtime in networks, power supply, gateway or similar failures of communication. Neither party will have any liability, other than for the payment of money owing, for their failure to perform any of their contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with events of force majeure.</p>
            <p class="body-lg light"><strong>Choice of Law.</strong> The Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the law of which Back n Forth is located. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with the Terms shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in which Back n Forth is located.</p>
